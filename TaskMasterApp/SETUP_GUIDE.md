## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Open in Android Studio
1. **Open Android Studio**
2. Click **"Open an Existing Project"**
3. Navigate to the `TaskMasterApp` folder
4. Click **"Open"**
5. Wait for Gradle sync to complete

### Step 2: Android SDK Setup
The project needs the Android SDK. Android Studio will automatically:
- Prompt you to install missing SDK components

- Set up the SDK path automatically

**If prompted:**
- Click **"Install missing SDK components"**
- Accept the licenses
- Wait for download to complete

### Step 3: Firebase Setup (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project called "TaskMaster"
3. Enable **Firestore Database** and **Authentication**
4. Download `google-services.json` 
5. Replace the placeholder file in `app/google-services.json`

### Step 4: Run the App

**Solution: Just open the project in Android Studio and everything will work! ✨**
